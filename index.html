      <h1>Hola <br> I'm ANYO</h1>
      <img src="images/GOPR0096.jpg" alt="profile picture" id="profile-pic">
      <p>My name is Anyoris, my friends also call me Anyo.
        I was born in the Dominican Republic in Santo Domingo, the oldest city of the new American continent.
        When I was 11 years old we moved to Germany. New friends, new school, new language - a new beginning. A change that has shaped me until now. I'm very thankful that I went through all this otherwise I wouldn't be where I am today.
        Sport supports me through my everyday life. Running, indoor cycling and yoga are part of my daily life routine, but also mountain biking and surfing. All those sports allows me to prove my strength and test my stamina.

        New cultures enrich me. Each year I try to travel to a different country to get to know the people and their cultures.

      <h2>Sporty</h2>

      <p>I'm passionate about <strong>sports</strong>! This really makes me happy.
        And whereever I'm or I want to go I combine everthing within the sport. During my Lewagon time I wake up at 6am to do my fav Sports and afterwards go to Lewagon Hub in Berlin.

      <h2>Plants & Jungles</h2>
      <p>This year I went for 2 month to south america. I <strong>dream</strong> which cames true. Jungles, deserts, beaches, and lot of adventures. In Peru and Bolivia you get to see a lot of deserts - Ecuador and Uruguay are really nice jungle with nice beaches. Back in Stuttgart where I used to live my livingroom looks like a urban jungle. Greens everywhere and pictures of plants and animals â€“ after a long day i love to sit down and stare at the plants and the pictures to relax a bit before I make myself something to eat.</p>

      <h2><strong>Food</strong> is everything!</h2>
      <p>Before I go to work and when I come back home I always and <strong>always</strong> make myself something fresh! As a veggie sometimes you have to take care of what you eat... If it looks veggie outside doesn't mean it's veggie inside. So thats why I mostly prepare my food myself. "Cover shit in gold is just supershiny shit" so be aware. Food != Food.</p>
